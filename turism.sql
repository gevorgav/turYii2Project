Artsakh meliks many\r\ntimes have put the military and material resources to ensure the victory of\r\nRussian arms, expecting to gain independence of the country.With the\r\nwholehearted participation of the Armenians, military victory of Russian army\r\nwas completed by the signing of Gulistan agreement on October 12-th, 1828, and\r\nTurkmenchay agreement on February 10-th, 1828.In accordance with the Gulistan\r\nТreaty, Karabakh, with the status of a separate national entity, passed under\r\nthe control of Russia. With the transition of Eastern Armenia, including\r\nArtsakh, to Russia, the Armenian people would not get the desired independence.\r\nPersian yoke was replaced by Russian. Despite their inputs, meliks were\r\ndeprived of their possessions, and even their own rights. Tatar khans and\r\nlords, to be obsequious with Russian rulers, became the masters of Armenian\r\nvillages and meliks’ estates.On May 12-th, 1920 the Soviet government of\r\nAzerbaijan with the support of the 11th Russian Red Army Sovietized Karabakh.\r\nAgain, the question of the so-called disputed territories arose in the arena.\r\nThe Bolsheviks involved in the process of the world revolution, to flatter their\r\nnew ally, Turkey, on July 5th, 1921 by the decision of the Caucasian Bureau of\r\nthe Bolshevik Russian Committee, handed over Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijan.For\r\nthe final separation of Nagorno Karabakh from Armenia in 1923, it was\r\nestablished Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region. Thus, Artsakh was separated\r\nfrom his native Armenia.At the end of the 80s the people of Artsakh once again\r\nwere forced to stand on the armed defense of their homes.In May and June of\r\n1991, the Azerbaijani special armed units (OMON), together with the Soviet\r\nArmy, conducted an operation \"Ring\". Accompanied by military\r\nhelicopters, battle tanks and armored vehicles, they attacked and destroyed the\r\nArmenian settlements of Getashen and Shahumyan regions.The next step to eradicate\r\nthe Armenians of Artsakh and take possession of the historical territories was\r\nthe extermination of the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region. In\r\nJune 1991, more than 20 Armenian villages of Martakert and Hadrout regions were\r\ncompletely destroyed; hundreds of women, children and elderly were killed and\r\nwounded. More than 700 people were captured, who had been tortured in\r\nAzerbaijani prisons. Thousands of people were forced to leave their ancestral\r\nhomeland.On September 2-nd, 1991 in Stepanakert, a joint meeting of the Councils\r\nof People\'s Deputies of the Nagorno-Karabakh region and the Shahumyan district\r\nadopted the Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh.Schools\r\nand cultural centers began to revive out of the ruins. It was necessary to\r\nsolve the day-to-day problems of thousands of displaced people from Azerbaijan.\r\nAll this was impossible without the participation of Armenia, without moral,\r\npolitical and material support of the Armenians all over the world. Hundreds of\r\nkilometers of roads, dozens of school buildings, cultural centers were built\r\nwith the support of the Diaspora.<o:p></o:p></span></p></p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '\r\n\r\n                <div class=\"template-5\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                        <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-sm-12\" contenteditable=\"false\">\r\n                                                <h2><br></h2>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-6 col-sm-12\" contenteditable=\"false\">\r\n                                                <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif;\r\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US\">Artsakh is located in the highlands southeast of the\r\nLesser Caucasus, on the extreme eastern part of the Great Hayk.

The power of this kingdom\r\nstrengthened the most in the end of the century, during the reign of Gregory\r\nAranshahik. In various provinces of Khachen, Aranshakhiks built impregnable fortresses\r\n- Khachenaberd, Levonaberd, Jraberd, delightful stone crosses-khachkars and\r\nmonastic complexes.Since the mid of 11th century, the prosperous life of the\r\nArtsakh principality was broken by invasions of Seljuk Turks. On the lands of\r\nthe Greeks and the Armenians the Turks established their own state, spreading\r\nevil and cruelty in the surrounding countries.

Armenian state of Artsakh was reborn. The main\r\nforces of Skhnakh army were concentrated in the provinces of Gyulistan and\r\nJraberd and at the foot of Mrav. It is also known as the Big Skhnakh, whose\r\nleader and inspirer was Gandzasar Catholicos Esai Hasan-Jalalyan. The province\r\nconsisting of five principalities, with the center in the settlement of Togh,\r\nled Dizakian Melik Egan, has been recognized as an independent state. Melik\r\nYegan using its warm relations with Nadir cared for the problems of Armenians\r\nin Eastern Armenia.In 1747, the Persian Shah was assassinated. The country\r\nbegan a period of anarchy. Taking advantage of the situation, the nomadic\r\nTurkic tribes, wandering in the area between the Kura-Araks, rallied around Panah,\r\nthe head of Sarudzhalil clan of Javanshir tribe. They settled in Tigranakert\r\nfortress in northeastern Artsakh, which in those days was called Shahbulag and\r\nfrom there attacked the princedoms of Khachen and Jraberd.</span><br></p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div class=\"img-100p\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"img-block\">\r\n                                                <img data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-title=\"Feedback\" src=\"http://storage.loc/web/img/about/d1d9a5e5-872d-4e02-866b-eea6098cf6fb.jpg\" alt=\"Gandzasar\" title=\"Gandzasar\">\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class=\"template-4\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                        <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-12 col-sm-12\">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable=\"false\"><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif;\r\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US\">The contradictions in the Russian-Persian relations\r\nsoon escalated into war of 1804-1813 and 1826-1828 years. Artsakh meliks many\r\ntimes have put the military and material resources to ensure the victory of\r\nRussian arms, expecting to gain independence of the country.With the\r\nwholehearted participation of the Armenians, military victory of Russian army\r\nwas completed by the signing of Gulistan agreement on October 12-th, 1828, and\r\nTurkmenchay agreement on February 10-th, 1828.In accordance with the Gulistan\r\nТreaty, Karabakh, with the status of a separate national entity, passed under\r\nthe control of Russia. With the transition of Eastern Armenia, including\r\nArtsakh, to Russia, the Armenian people would not get the desired independence.\r\nPersian yoke was replaced by Russian. Despite their inputs, meliks were\r\ndeprived of their possessions, and even their own rights. Tatar khans and\r\nlords, to be obsequious with Russian rulers, became the masters of Armenian\r\nvillages and meliks’ estates.On May 12-th, 1920 the Soviet government of\r\nAzerbaijan with the support of the 11th Russian Red Army Sovietized Karabakh.\r\nAgain, the question of the so-called disputed territories arose in the arena.\r\nThe Bolsheviks involved in the process of the world revolution, to flatter their\r\nnew ally, Turkey, on July 5th, 1921 by the decision of the Caucasian Bureau of\r\nthe Bolshevik Russian Committee, handed over Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijan.For\r\nthe final separation of Nagorno Karabakh from Armenia in 1923, it was\r\nestablished Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region. Thus, Artsakh was separated\r\nfrom his native Armenia.At the end of the 80s the people of Artsakh once again\r\nwere forced to stand on the armed defense of their homes.In May and June of\r\n1991, the Azerbaijani special armed units (OMON), together with the Soviet\r\nArmy, conducted an operation \"Ring\". Accompanied by military\r\nhelicopters, battle tanks and armored vehicles, they attacked and destroyed the\r\nArmenian settlements of Getashen and Shahumyan regions.The next step to eradicate\r\nthe Armenians of Artsakh and take possession of the historical territories was\r\nthe extermination of the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region. In\r\nJune 1991, more than 20 Armenian villages of Martakert and Hadrout regions were\r\ncompletely destroyed; hundreds of women, children and elderly were killed and\r\nwounded. More than 700 people were captured, who had been tortured in\r\nAzerbaijani prisons. Thousands of people were forced to leave their ancestral\r\nhomeland.On September 2-nd, 1991 in Stepanakert, a joint meeting of the Councils\r\nof People\'s Deputies of the Nagorno-Karabakh region and the Shahumyan district\r\nadopted the Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh.Schools\r\nand cultural centers began to revive out of the ruins.

Armenian state of Artsakh was reborn. The main\r\nforces of Skhnakh army were concentrated in the provinces of Gyulistan and\r\nJraberd and at the foot of Mrav. It is also known as the Big Skhnakh, whose\r\nleader and inspirer was Gandzasar Catholicos Esai Hasan-Jalalyan. The province\r\nconsisting of five principalities, with the center in the settlement of Togh,\r\nled Dizakian Melik Egan, has been recognized as an independent state. Melik\r\nYegan using its warm relations with Nadir cared for the problems of Armenians\r\nin Eastern Armenia.In 1747, the Persian Shah was assassinated. The country\r\nbegan a period of anarchy. Taking advantage of the situation, the nomadic\r\nTurkic tribes, wandering in the area between the Kura-Araks, rallied around Panah,\r\nthe head of Sarudzhalil clan of Javanshir tribe. They settled in Tigranakert\r\nfortress in northeastern Artsakh, which in those days was called Shahbulag and\r\nfrom there attacked the princedoms of Khachen and Jraberd.</span><br></p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div class=\"img-100p\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"img-block\">\r\n                                                <img data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-title=\"Feedback\" src=\"http://storage.loc/web/img/about/d1d9a5e5-872d-4e02-866b-eea6098cf6fb.jpg\" alt=\"Gandzasar\" title=\"Gandzasar\">\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class=\"template-4\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                        <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-12 col-sm-12\">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable=\"false\"><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif;\r\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US\">The contradictions in the Russian-Persian relations\r\nsoon escalated into war of 1804-1813 and 1826-1828 years. Artsakh meliks many\r\ntimes have put the military and material resources to ensure the victory of\r\nRussian arms, expecting to gain independence of the country.With the\r\nwholehearted participation of the Armenians, military victory of Russian army\r\nwas completed by the signing of Gulistan agreement on October 12-th, 1828, and\r\nTurkmenchay agreement on February 10-th, 1828.In accordance with the Gulistan\r\nТreaty, Karabakh, with the status of a separate national entity, passed under\r\nthe control of Russia. With the transition of Eastern Armenia, including\r\nArtsakh, to Russia, the Armenian people would not get the desired independence.\r\nPersian yoke was replaced by Russian. Despite their inputs, meliks were\r\ndeprived of their possessions, and even their own rights. Tatar khans and\r\nlords, to be obsequious with Russian rulers, became the masters of Armenian\r\nvillages and meliks’ estates.On May 12-th, 1920 the Soviet government of\r\nAzerbaijan with the support of the 11th Russian Red Army Sovietized Karabakh.\r\nAgain, the question of the so-called disputed territories arose in the arena.\r\nThe Bolsheviks involved in the process of the world revolution, to flatter their\r\nnew ally, Turkey, on July 5th, 1921 by the decision of the Caucasian Bureau of\r\nthe Bolshevik Russian Committee, handed over Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijan.For\r\nthe final separation of Nagorno Karabakh from Armenia in 1923, it was\r\nestablished Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region. Thus, Artsakh was separated\r\nfrom his native Armenia.At the end of the 80s the people of Artsakh once again\r\nwere forced to stand on the armed defense of their homes.In May and June of\r\n1991, the Azerbaijani special armed units (OMON), together with the Soviet\r\nArmy, conducted an operation \"Ring\". Accompanied by military\r\nhelicopters, battle tanks and armored vehicles, they attacked and destroyed the\r\nArmenian settlements of Getashen and Shahumyan regions.The next step to eradicate\r\nthe Armenians of Artsakh and take possession of the historical territories was\r\nthe extermination of the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region. In\r\nJune 1991, more than 20 Armenian villages of Martakert and Hadrout regions were\r\ncompletely destroyed; hundreds of women, children and elderly were killed and\r\nwounded. More than 700 people were captured, who had been tortured in\r\nAzerbaijani prisons. Thousands of people were forced to leave their ancestral\r\nhomeland.On September 2-nd, 1991 in Stepanakert, a joint meeting of the Councils\r\nof People\'s Deputies of the Nagorno-Karabakh region and the Shahumyan district\r\nadopted the Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh.Schools\r\nand cultural centers began to revive out of the ruins. It was necessary to\r\nsolve the day-to-day problems of thousands of displaced people from Azerbaijan.\r\nAll this was impossible without the participation of Armenia, without moral,\r\npolitical and material support of the Armenians all over the world. Hundreds of\r\nkilometers of roads, dozens of school buildings, cultural centers were built\r\nwith the support of the Diaspora.<o:p></o:p></span></p></p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '\r\n\r\n                <div class=\"template-5\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                        <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-sm-12\" contenteditable=\"false\">\r\n                                                <h2><br></h2>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-6 col-sm-12\" contenteditable=\"false\">\r\n                                                <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif;\r\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US\">Artsakh is located in the highlands southeast of the\r\nLesser Caucasus, on the extreme eastern part of the Great Hayk.

Despite their inputs, meliks were\r\ndeprived of their possessions, and even their own rights. Tatar khans and\r\nlords, to be obsequious with Russian rulers, became the masters of Armenian\r\nvillages and meliks’ estates.On May 12-th, 1920 the Soviet government of\r\nAzerbaijan with the support of the 11th Russian Red Army Sovietized Karabakh.\r\nAgain, the question of the so-called disputed territories arose in the arena.\r\nThe Bolsheviks involved in the process of the world revolution, to flatter their\r\nnew ally, Turkey, on July 5th, 1921 by the decision of the Caucasian Bureau of\r\nthe Bolshevik Russian Committee, handed over Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijan.For\r\nthe final separation of Nagorno Karabakh from Armenia in 1923, it was\r\nestablished Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region. Thus, Artsakh was separated\r\nfrom his native Armenia.At the end of the 80s the people of Artsakh once again\r\nwere forced to stand on the armed defense of their homes.In May and June of\r\n1991, the Azerbaijani special armed units (OMON), together with the Soviet\r\nArmy, conducted an operation \"Ring\". Accompanied by military\r\nhelicopters, battle tanks and armored vehicles, they attacked and destroyed the\r\nArmenian settlements of Getashen and Shahumyan regions.The next step to eradicate\r\nthe Armenians of Artsakh and take possession of the historical territories was\r\nthe extermination of the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region. In\r\nJune 1991, more than 20 Armenian villages of Martakert and Hadrout regions were\r\ncompletely destroyed; hundreds of women, children and elderly were killed and\r\nwounded. More than 700 people were captured, who had been tortured in\r\nAzerbaijani prisons. Thousands of people were forced to leave their ancestral\r\nhomeland.On September 2-nd, 1991 in Stepanakert, a joint meeting of the Councils\r\nof People\'s Deputies of the Nagorno-Karabakh region and the Shahumyan district\r\nadopted the Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh.Schools\r\nand cultural centers began to revive out of the ruins.

It borders in the north and northwest with Martakert region, and in the west with Kashatagh region. The southern border reaches Hadrout and Martouni regions, and the southeast border also touches Martouni region. The northwest of Askeran reaches the border with Azerbaijan. This region occupies an area of 1222 sq. km., and the population here is 17 400 people. In Askeran there are 45 settlements, one of which is the city of Askeran, located about fourteen kilometers from the RA capital of Stepanakert.

Every Armenian knows that Noah, having reached this holy land, planted a vine in Armenia. That was the beginning of viticulture in Armenia. Archaeological excavations have shown that the Armenians were engaged in winemaking since the beginning of the 10th century BC .Since ancient times, the Armenians were able to produce a good wine, and grape growing techniques have remained virtually unchanged since the time of Urartu. So it is in Artsakh. In the courtyards of the families, involved in winemaking, were installed the winepresses. Exclusively male pressed the grapes. There is a special type of grapes in Arsakh with high sugar content, so it produces more alcohol. There are prevalent grape varieties as Haghtanak, Areni, Kishmish. Tourists in Artsakh can watch in rural areas how is distilled the traditional home-made mulberry vodka, which is famous for its healing properties. Mulberries are stored in barrels for 8-10 days until start to wander, and then the mixture is simmered in a big vat. Steam of the boiling mixture passes through the tube, is cooled by water and in the form of alcohol flows into the barrel. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12\">\r\n                                               <div class=\"img-block\">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-title=\"Feedback\" src=\"https://bltscottsdale.com/wp-content/themes/pashmina/images/blank.png\" alt=\"Hyunot\">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '                <div class=\"template-4\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                        <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-12 col-sm-12\">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable=\"false\">Karabakh cuisine, as well as the history of Karabakh, is rooted in antiquity.

Every Armenian knows that Noah, having reached this holy land, planted a vine in Armenia. That was the beginning of viticulture in Armenia. Archaeological excavations have shown that the Armenians were engaged in winemaking since the beginning of the 10th century BC .Since ancient times, the Armenians were able to produce a good wine, and grape growing techniques have remained virtually unchanged since the time of Urartu. So it is in Artsakh. In the courtyards of the families, involved in winemaking, were installed the winepresses. Exclusively male pressed the grapes. There is a special type of grapes in Arsakh with high sugar content, so it produces more alcohol. There are prevalent grape varieties as Haghtanak, Areni, Kishmish. Tourists in Artsakh can watch in rural areas how is distilled the traditional home-made mulberry vodka, which is famous for its healing properties. Mulberries are stored in barrels for 8-10 days until start to wander, and then the mixture is simmered in a big vat. Steam of the boiling mixture passes through the tube, is cooled by water and in the form of alcohol flows into the barrel. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12\">\r\n                                               <div class=\"img-block\">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-title=\"Feedback\" src=\"https://bltscottsdale.com/wp-content/themes/pashmina/images/blank.png\" alt=\"Hyunot\">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '                <div class=\"template-4\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                        <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-12 col-sm-12\">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable=\"false\">Karabakh cuisine, as well as the history of Karabakh, is rooted in antiquity.

Every Armenian knows that Noah, having reached this holy land, planted a vine in Armenia. That was the beginning of viticulture in Armenia. Archaeological excavations have shown that the Armenians were engaged in winemaking since the beginning of the 10th century BC .Since ancient times, the Armenians were able to produce a good wine, and grape growing techniques have remained virtually unchanged since the time of Urartu. So it is in Artsakh. In the courtyards of the families, involved in winemaking, were installed the winepresses. Exclusively male pressed the grapes. There is a special type of grapes in Arsakh with high sugar content, so it produces more alcohol. There are prevalent grape varieties as Haghtanak, Areni, Kishmish. Tourists in Artsakh can watch in rural areas how is distilled the traditional home-made mulberry vodka, which is famous for its healing properties. Mulberries are stored in barrels for 8-10 days until start to wander, and then the mixture is simmered in a big vat. Steam of the boiling mixture passes through the tube, is cooled by water and in the form of alcohol flows into the barrel. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12\">\r\n                                               <div class=\"img-block\">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-title=\"Feedback\" src=\"https://bltscottsdale.com/wp-content/themes/pashmina/images/blank.png\" alt=\"Hyunot\">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '                <div class=\"template-4\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                        <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-12 col-sm-12\">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable=\"false\">Karabakh cuisine, as well as the history of Karabakh, is rooted in antiquity.

Every Armenian knows that Noah, having reached this holy land, planted a vine in Armenia. That was the beginning of viticulture in Armenia. Archaeological excavations have shown that the Armenians were engaged in winemaking since the beginning of the 10th century BC .Since ancient times, the Armenians were able to produce a good wine, and grape growing techniques have remained virtually unchanged since the time of Urartu. So it is in Artsakh. In the courtyards of the families, involved in winemaking, were installed the winepresses. Exclusively male pressed the grapes. There is a special type of grapes in Arsakh with high sugar content, so it produces more alcohol. There are prevalent grape varieties as Haghtanak, Areni, Kishmish. Tourists in Artsakh can watch in rural areas how is distilled the traditional home-made mulberry vodka, which is famous for its healing properties. Mulberries are stored in barrels for 8-10 days until start to wander, and then the mixture is simmered in a big vat. Steam of the boiling mixture passes through the tube, is cooled by water and in the form of alcohol flows into the barrel. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12\">\r\n                                               <div class=\"img-block\">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-title=\"Feedback\" src=\"https://bltscottsdale.com/wp-content/themes/pashmina/images/blank.png\" alt=\"Hyunot\">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '                <div class=\"template-4\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                        <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-12 col-sm-12\">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable=\"false\">Karabakh cuisine, as well as the history of Karabakh, is rooted in antiquity.

Every Armenian knows that Noah, having reached this holy land, planted a vine in Armenia. That was the beginning of viticulture in Armenia. Archaeological excavations have shown that the Armenians were engaged in winemaking since the beginning of the 10th century BC .Since ancient times, the Armenians were able to produce a good wine, and grape growing techniques have remained virtually unchanged since the time of Urartu. So it is in Artsakh. In the courtyards of the families, involved in winemaking, were installed the winepresses. Exclusively male pressed the grapes. There is a special type of grapes in Arsakh with high sugar content, so it produces more alcohol. There are prevalent grape varieties as Haghtanak, Areni, Kishmish. Tourists in Artsakh can watch in rural areas how is distilled the traditional home-made mulberry vodka, which is famous for its healing properties. Mulberries are stored in barrels for 8-10 days until start to wander, and then the mixture is simmered in a big vat. Steam of the boiling mixture passes through the tube, is cooled by water and in the form of alcohol flows into the barrel. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12\">\r\n                                               <div class=\"img-block\">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-title=\"Feedback\" src=\"https://bltscottsdale.com/wp-content/themes/pashmina/images/blank.png\" alt=\"Hyunot\">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '                <div class=\"template-4\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                        <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-12 col-sm-12\">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable=\"false\">Karabakh cuisine, as well as the history of Karabakh, is rooted in antiquity.

Every Armenian knows that Noah, having reached this holy land, planted a vine in Armenia. That was the beginning of viticulture in Armenia. Archaeological excavations have shown that the Armenians were engaged in winemaking since the beginning of the 10th century BC .Since ancient times, the Armenians were able to produce a good wine, and grape growing techniques have remained virtually unchanged since the time of Urartu. So it is in Artsakh. In the courtyards of the families, involved in winemaking, were installed the winepresses. Exclusively male pressed the grapes. There is a special type of grapes in Arsakh with high sugar content, so it produces more alcohol. There are prevalent grape varieties as Haghtanak, Areni, Kishmish. Tourists in Artsakh can watch in rural areas how is distilled the traditional home-made mulberry vodka, which is famous for its healing properties. Mulberries are stored in barrels for 8-10 days until start to wander, and then the mixture is simmered in a big vat. Steam of the boiling mixture passes through the tube, is cooled by water and in the form of alcohol flows into the barrel. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12\">\r\n                                               <div class=\"img-block\">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-title=\"Feedback\" src=\"https://bltscottsdale.com/wp-content/themes/pashmina/images/blank.png\" alt=\"Hyunot\">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '                <div class=\"template-4\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                        <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-12 col-sm-12\">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable=\"false\">Karabakh cuisine, as well as the history of Karabakh, is rooted in antiquity.

Every Armenian knows that Noah, having reached this holy land, planted a vine in Armenia. That was the beginning of viticulture in Armenia. Archaeological excavations have shown that the Armenians were engaged in winemaking since the beginning of the 10th century BC .Since ancient times, the Armenians were able to produce a good wine, and grape growing techniques have remained virtually unchanged since the time of Urartu. So it is in Artsakh. In the courtyards of the families, involved in winemaking, were installed the winepresses. Exclusively male pressed the grapes. There is a special type of grapes in Arsakh with high sugar content, so it produces more alcohol. There are prevalent grape varieties as Haghtanak, Areni, Kishmish. Tourists in Artsakh can watch in rural areas how is distilled the traditional home-made mulberry vodka, which is famous for its healing properties. Mulberries are stored in barrels for 8-10 days until start to wander, and then the mixture is simmered in a big vat. Steam of the boiling mixture passes through the tube, is cooled by water and in the form of alcohol flows into the barrel. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12\">\r\n                                               <div class=\"img-block\">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-title=\"Feedback\" src=\"https://bltscottsdale.com/wp-content/themes/pashmina/images/blank.png\" alt=\"Hyunot\">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '                <div class=\"template-4\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                        <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-12 col-sm-12\">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable=\"false\">Karabakh cuisine, as well as the history of Karabakh, is rooted in antiquity.

In particular, we cannot refuse to try horse sorrel, mallow or snowdrop bulbs, which are first blanched in boiling water for a few minutes, and then either added to soups and salads, or seasoned with onions and eggs. Such dishes are usually served with yoghurt and nuts. An interesting component of the Karabakh cuisine is a special kind of bread – tonrahats, the flat bread baked in special cylindrical shape clay ovens dug in the ground (tonirs). Its baking is time-consuming ritual process; tonrahats is baked only in Karabakh. Also popular in Artsakh is the other kind of bread, traditional for the entire Armenian - lavash, which usually is used to roll up an Armenian cheese or meat, seasoned with onions, herbs and pepper. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12\">\r\n                                               <div class=\"img-block\">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-title=\"Feedback\" src=\"https://bltscottsdale.com/wp-content/themes/pashmina/images/blank.png\" alt=\"Hyunot\">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class=\"template-1\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                       <div class=\"item\">\r\n                                          <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-7 col-sm-12 com-xs-12\" contenteditable=\"false\">\r\n                                                <h2>Winemaking<br></h2>\r\n                                                <p>Winemaking. Every Armenian knows that Noah, having reached this holy land, planted a vine in Armenia. That was the beginning of viticulture in Armenia. Archaeological excavations have shown that the Armenians were engaged in winemaking since the beginning of the 10th century BC .Since ancient times, the Armenians were able to produce a good wine, and grape growing techniques have remained virtually unchanged since the time of Urartu. So it is in Artsakh. In the courtyards of the families, involved in winemaking, were installed the winepresses. Exclusively male pressed the grapes. There is a special type of grapes in Arsakh with high sugar content, so it produces more alcohol. There are prevalent grape varieties as Haghtanak, Areni, Kishmish. Tourists in Artsakh can watch in rural areas how is distilled the traditional home-made mulberry vodka, which is famous for its healing properties. Mulberries are stored in barrels for 8-10 days until start to wander, and then the mixture is simmered in a big vat. Steam of the boiling mixture passes through the tube, is cooled by water and in the form of alcohol flows into the barrel. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12\">\r\n                                               <div class=\"img-block\">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-title=\"Feedback\" src=\"https://bltscottsdale.com/wp-content/themes/pashmina/images/blank.png\" alt=\"Hyunot\">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 8, 'http://storage.loc/source', '1/ZonrIAB6bc61PSIDPJgpu0VG2cFRz-VU.jpg', NULL, NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1519516250, 1519516250, 1519518229);

Wall decorations, blankets, towels, tablecloths, skillfully embroidered curtains - all this at all times graced life, creating comfort and warmth. Every girl before marriage wove and embroidered items for dowry, and collected them all in canvas bag - boghchah. The boghchah itself was a masterpieces masterpiece of needlework. \"...Fabrics and colors colours, created by Artsakh women, cannot be compared with anything,\" - wrote the Arab historian Al-Maksuddasi. Skilled Artsakh creativity, lacy patterns (images) repeated images of medieval khachkars cars and miniatures. Women widely used simple stitch, chain, cross, knots, quiet, rococo seam over the edge and different types of yarns - cotton, linen, silk, wool.

Unique designs make them true masterpieces. Both sides of gulpa, top and bottom, have white square-shaped patterns, rounded with knit openwork patterns. And in our time in each house to keep something from \"my grandmother\'s dowry\" - embroidered pillow lace veil, or tied with a pair of Gulpa, which preserved the old patterns.

Before the spread of synthetic aniline dyes in the 1870\'s, the rich coloring of the Karabakh carpets was reached only with natural dyes derived from specific plants and minerals of region. Indigo (bluing) was imported from the East, and Vordan - from the Ararat valley. Some of the villages and settlements do not consider synthetic dyes, remaining true to the traditional natural methods.</span><br></p><div><br></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-6 col-sm-12\" contenteditable=\"false\">\r\n                                                <p>Director of the Armenian Studies Program of the University of Fresno, California, Tigran Kouyoumdjian argues that many different ancient sources testify to the skill of carpet weaving and the manufacture of other fabrics. Carpet \"Gohar\", a unique example of ancient Armenian carpeting that Tigran Kouyoumdjian described as \"the biggest and softest\", was woven in Karabakh and has a signature, which specifies the name of the weaver, \"Gohar\" and the date 1700. Another well-known carpet, woven in 1731 in Artsakh for Catholicos of Aghvank - Nerses, is stored in the Jerusalem Church of St. James.</p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div class=\"img-100p\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"img-block\">\r\n                                                <img data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-title=\"Feedback\" src=\"http://storage.loc/web/img/about/carpet.jpg\" alt=\"Gandzasar\" title=\"Gandzasar\">\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class=\"template-5\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                        <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-sm-12\" contenteditable=\"false\">\r\n                                                <h2><br></h2>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-6 col-sm-12\" contenteditable=\"false\">\r\n                                                <p>In Karabakh, as well as in other regions of Armenia, the carpets were made originally not for sale. They were considered objects of everyday life and of the family, but not traded. Bear rug from home was considered a bad omen. Carpets -Family relics - were important talisman and often symbolized fertility.In the early twentieth century in most cities producing of handmade carpets have been discontinued due to mass killings and deportations, when have been lost or destroyed valuable Armenian carpets. The art of carpet weaving passed from generation to generation, but the destruction and the separation of families have made it almost impossible to continue this tradition.\r\n                                                </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-6 col-sm-12\" contenteditable=\"false\">\r\n                                                <p>However, the Karabakh carpet weaving as an art form remained in the Soviet era.

It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\r\n\r\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.
