Thus, Artsakh was separated\r\nfrom his native Armenia.At the end of the 80s the people of Artsakh once again\r\nwere forced to stand on the armed defense of their homes.In May and June of\r\n1991, the Azerbaijani special armed units (OMON), together with the Soviet\r\nArmy, conducted an operation \"Ring\". Accompanied by military\r\nhelicopters, battle tanks and armored vehicles, they attacked and destroyed the\r\nArmenian settlements of Getashen and Shahumyan regions.The next step to eradicate\r\nthe Armenians of Artsakh and take possession of the historical territories was\r\nthe extermination of the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region. In\r\nJune 1991, more than 20 Armenian villages of Martakert and Hadrout regions were\r\ncompletely destroyed; hundreds of women, children and elderly were killed and\r\nwounded. More than 700 people were captured, who had been tortured in\r\nAzerbaijani prisons. Thousands of people were forced to leave their ancestral\r\nhomeland.On September 2-nd, 1991 in Stepanakert, a joint meeting of the Councils\r\nof People\'s Deputies of the Nagorno-Karabakh region and the Shahumyan district\r\nadopted the Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh.Schools\r\nand cultural centers began to revive out of the ruins.

In\r\nJune 1991, more than 20 Armenian villages of Martakert and Hadrout regions were\r\ncompletely destroyed; hundreds of women, children and elderly were killed and\r\nwounded. More than 700 people were captured, who had been tortured in\r\nAzerbaijani prisons.

Armenian state of Artsakh was reborn. The main\r\nforces of Skhnakh army were concentrated in the provinces of Gyulistan and\r\nJraberd and at the foot of Mrav. It is also known as the Big Skhnakh, whose\r\nleader and inspirer was Gandzasar Catholicos Esai Hasan-Jalalyan.

Armenian state of Artsakh was reborn. The main\r\nforces of Skhnakh army were concentrated in the provinces of Gyulistan and\r\nJraberd and at the foot of Mrav. It is also known as the Big Skhnakh, whose\r\nleader and inspirer was Gandzasar Catholicos Esai Hasan-Jalalyan. The province\r\nconsisting of five principalities, with the center in the settlement of Togh,\r\nled Dizakian Melik Egan, has been recognized as an independent state. Melik\r\nYegan using its warm relations with Nadir cared for the problems of Armenians\r\nin Eastern Armenia.In 1747, the Persian Shah was assassinated. The country\r\nbegan a period of anarchy. Taking advantage of the situation, the nomadic\r\nTurkic tribes, wandering in the area between the Kura-Araks, rallied around Panah,\r\nthe head of Sarudzhalil clan of Javanshir tribe. They settled in Tigranakert\r\nfortress in northeastern Artsakh, which in those days was called Shahbulag and\r\nfrom there attacked the princedoms of Khachen and Jraberd.</span><br></p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div class=\"img-100p\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"img-block\">\r\n                                                <img data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-title=\"Feedback\" src=\"http://storage.loc/web/img/about/d1d9a5e5-872d-4e02-866b-eea6098cf6fb.jpg\" alt=\"Gandzasar\" title=\"Gandzasar\">\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class=\"template-4\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                        <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-12 col-sm-12\">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable=\"false\"><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif;\r\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US\">The contradictions in the Russian-Persian relations\r\nsoon escalated into war of 1804-1813 and 1826-1828 years. Artsakh meliks many\r\ntimes have put the military and material resources to ensure the victory of\r\nRussian arms, expecting to gain independence of the country.With the\r\nwholehearted participation of the Armenians, military victory of Russian army\r\nwas completed by the signing of Gulistan agreement on October 12-th, 1828, and\r\nTurkmenchay agreement on February 10-th, 1828.In accordance with the Gulistan\r\nТreaty, Karabakh, with the status of a separate national entity, passed under\r\nthe control of Russia. With the transition of Eastern Armenia, including\r\nArtsakh, to Russia, the Armenian people would not get the desired independence.\r\nPersian yoke was replaced by Russian. Despite their inputs, meliks were\r\ndeprived of their possessions, and even their own rights. Tatar khans and\r\nlords, to be obsequious with Russian rulers, became the masters of Armenian\r\nvillages and meliks’ estates.On May 12-th, 1920 the Soviet government of\r\nAzerbaijan with the support of the 11th Russian Red Army Sovietized Karabakh.\r\nAgain, the question of the so-called disputed territories arose in the arena.\r\nThe Bolsheviks involved in the process of the world revolution, to flatter their\r\nnew ally, Turkey, on July 5th, 1921 by the decision of the Caucasian Bureau of\r\nthe Bolshevik Russian Committee, handed over Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijan.For\r\nthe final separation of Nagorno Karabakh from Armenia in 1923, it was\r\nestablished Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region. Thus, Artsakh was separated\r\nfrom his native Armenia.At the end of the 80s the people of Artsakh once again\r\nwere forced to stand on the armed defense of their homes.In May and June of\r\n1991, the Azerbaijani special armed units (OMON), together with the Soviet\r\nArmy, conducted an operation \"Ring\". Accompanied by military\r\nhelicopters, battle tanks and armored vehicles, they attacked and destroyed the\r\nArmenian settlements of Getashen and Shahumyan regions.The next step to eradicate\r\nthe Armenians of Artsakh and take possession of the historical territories was\r\nthe extermination of the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region. In\r\nJune 1991, more than 20 Armenian villages of Martakert and Hadrout regions were\r\ncompletely destroyed; hundreds of women, children and elderly were killed and\r\nwounded. More than 700 people were captured, who had been tortured in\r\nAzerbaijani prisons. Thousands of people were forced to leave their ancestral\r\nhomeland.On September 2-nd, 1991 in Stepanakert, a joint meeting of the Councils\r\nof People\'s Deputies of the Nagorno-Karabakh region and the Shahumyan district\r\nadopted the Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh.Schools\r\nand cultural centers began to revive out of the ruins. It was necessary to\r\nsolve the day-to-day problems of thousands of displaced people from Azerbaijan.\r\nAll this was impossible without the participation of Armenia, without moral,\r\npolitical and material support of the Armenians all over the world. Hundreds of\r\nkilometers of roads, dozens of school buildings, cultural centers were built\r\nwith the support of the Diaspora.<o:p></o:p></span></p></p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '\r\n\r\n                <div class=\"template-5\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                        <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-sm-12\" contenteditable=\"false\">\r\n                                                <h2><br></h2>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-6 col-sm-12\" contenteditable=\"false\">\r\n                                                <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif;\r\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US\">Artsakh is located in the highlands southeast of the\r\nLesser Caucasus, on the extreme eastern part of the Great Hayk.

Thus, Artsakh was separated\r\nfrom his native Armenia.At the end of the 80s the people of Artsakh once again\r\nwere forced to stand on the armed defense of their homes.In May and June of\r\n1991, the Azerbaijani special armed units (OMON), together with the Soviet\r\nArmy, conducted an operation \"Ring\". Accompanied by military\r\nhelicopters, battle tanks and armored vehicles, they attacked and destroyed the\r\nArmenian settlements of Getashen and Shahumyan regions.The next step to eradicate\r\nthe Armenians of Artsakh and take possession of the historical territories was\r\nthe extermination of the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region. In\r\nJune 1991, more than 20 Armenian villages of Martakert and Hadrout regions were\r\ncompletely destroyed; hundreds of women, children and elderly were killed and\r\nwounded. More than 700 people were captured, who had been tortured in\r\nAzerbaijani prisons. Thousands of people were forced to leave their ancestral\r\nhomeland.On September 2-nd, 1991 in Stepanakert, a joint meeting of the Councils\r\nof People\'s Deputies of the Nagorno-Karabakh region and the Shahumyan district\r\nadopted the Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh.Schools\r\nand cultural centers began to revive out of the ruins.

In\r\nJune 1991, more than 20 Armenian villages of Martakert and Hadrout regions were\r\ncompletely destroyed; hundreds of women, children and elderly were killed and\r\nwounded. More than 700 people were captured, who had been tortured in\r\nAzerbaijani prisons.

Armenian state of Artsakh was reborn. The main\r\nforces of Skhnakh army were concentrated in the provinces of Gyulistan and\r\nJraberd and at the foot of Mrav. It is also known as the Big Skhnakh, whose\r\nleader and inspirer was Gandzasar Catholicos Esai Hasan-Jalalyan.

One of the cities was founded in\r\nArtsakh at the foot of Vankasar mount.Through the efforts of the Armenian\r\narchaeologists in 2006 deep under the ground were discovered the remains of ancient\r\nstructures of Artsakhian Tigranakert, which over and over again is a proof to “blind\r\nand deaf” opponents of the Armenian people that since the times of Noah, this\r\nland was inhabited by Armenians and imbued with the Armenian spirit.In Rome,\r\nyou can find a map of the world preserved from the time of Nero, carved on a\r\nmarble wall. Artsakh is marked on it as one of the provinces of the Armenian\r\nstate.

He\r\nbuilt as many churches as days in the year and showed earnest efforts to\r\ndisseminate education.In the 9th century, the kingdom of Khachen was formed in\r\nthe western and northern regions of Artsakh. The power of this kingdom\r\nstrengthened the most in the end of the century, during the reign of Gregory\r\nAranshahik. In various provinces of Khachen, Aranshakhiks built impregnable fortresses\r\n- Khachenaberd, Levonaberd, Jraberd, delightful stone crosses-khachkars and\r\nmonastic complexes.Since the mid of 11th century, the prosperous life of the\r\nArtsakh principality was broken by invasions of Seljuk Turks. On the lands of\r\nthe Greeks and the Armenians the Turks established their own state, spreading\r\nevil and cruelty in the surrounding countries.

Armenian state of Artsakh was reborn. The main\r\nforces of Skhnakh army were concentrated in the provinces of Gyulistan and\r\nJraberd and at the foot of Mrav. It is also known as the Big Skhnakh, whose\r\nleader and inspirer was Gandzasar Catholicos Esai Hasan-Jalalyan. The province\r\nconsisting of five principalities, with the center in the settlement of Togh,\r\nled Dizakian Melik Egan, has been recognized as an independent state. Melik\r\nYegan using its warm relations with Nadir cared for the problems of Armenians\r\nin Eastern Armenia.In 1747, the Persian Shah was assassinated. The country\r\nbegan a period of anarchy. Taking advantage of the situation, the nomadic\r\nTurkic tribes, wandering in the area between the Kura-Araks, rallied around Panah,\r\nthe head of Sarudzhalil clan of Javanshir tribe. They settled in Tigranakert\r\nfortress in northeastern Artsakh, which in those days was called Shahbulag and\r\nfrom there attacked the princedoms of Khachen and Jraberd.</span><br></p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div class=\"img-100p\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"img-block\">\r\n                                                <img data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-title=\"Feedback\" src=\"http://storage.loc/web/img/about/d1d9a5e5-872d-4e02-866b-eea6098cf6fb.jpg\" alt=\"Gandzasar\" title=\"Gandzasar\">\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class=\"template-4\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                        <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-12 col-sm-12\">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable=\"false\"><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif;\r\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US\">The contradictions in the Russian-Persian relations\r\nsoon escalated into war of 1804-1813 and 1826-1828 years. Artsakh meliks many\r\ntimes have put the military and material resources to ensure the victory of\r\nRussian arms, expecting to gain independence of the country.With the\r\nwholehearted participation of the Armenians, military victory of Russian army\r\nwas completed by the signing of Gulistan agreement on October 12-th, 1828, and\r\nTurkmenchay agreement on February 10-th, 1828.In accordance with the Gulistan\r\nТreaty, Karabakh, with the status of a separate national entity, passed under\r\nthe control of Russia. With the transition of Eastern Armenia, including\r\nArtsakh, to Russia, the Armenian people would not get the desired independence.\r\nPersian yoke was replaced by Russian. Despite their inputs, meliks were\r\ndeprived of their possessions, and even their own rights. Tatar khans and\r\nlords, to be obsequious with Russian rulers, became the masters of Armenian\r\nvillages and meliks’ estates.On May 12-th, 1920 the Soviet government of\r\nAzerbaijan with the support of the 11th Russian Red Army Sovietized Karabakh.\r\nAgain, the question of the so-called disputed territories arose in the arena.\r\nThe Bolsheviks involved in the process of the world revolution, to flatter their\r\nnew ally, Turkey, on July 5th, 1921 by the decision of the Caucasian Bureau of\r\nthe Bolshevik Russian Committee, handed over Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijan.For\r\nthe final separation of Nagorno Karabakh from Armenia in 1923, it was\r\nestablished Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region. Thus, Artsakh was separated\r\nfrom his native Armenia.At the end of the 80s the people of Artsakh once again\r\nwere forced to stand on the armed defense of their homes.In May and June of\r\n1991, the Azerbaijani special armed units (OMON), together with the Soviet\r\nArmy, conducted an operation \"Ring\". Accompanied by military\r\nhelicopters, battle tanks and armored vehicles, they attacked and destroyed the\r\nArmenian settlements of Getashen and Shahumyan regions.The next step to eradicate\r\nthe Armenians of Artsakh and take possession of the historical territories was\r\nthe extermination of the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region. In\r\nJune 1991, more than 20 Armenian villages of Martakert and Hadrout regions were\r\ncompletely destroyed; hundreds of women, children and elderly were killed and\r\nwounded. More than 700 people were captured, who had been tortured in\r\nAzerbaijani prisons. Thousands of people were forced to leave their ancestral\r\nhomeland.On September 2-nd, 1991 in Stepanakert, a joint meeting of the Councils\r\nof People\'s Deputies of the Nagorno-Karabakh region and the Shahumyan district\r\nadopted the Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh.Schools\r\nand cultural centers began to revive out of the ruins. It was necessary to\r\nsolve the day-to-day problems of thousands of displaced people from Azerbaijan.\r\nAll this was impossible without the participation of Armenia, without moral,\r\npolitical and material support of the Armenians all over the world. Hundreds of\r\nkilometers of roads, dozens of school buildings, cultural centers were built\r\nwith the support of the Diaspora.<o:p></o:p></span></p></p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 7, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1519511465, 1519511465, 1519511465);

Church and state are separated within the republic, and act separately from one another.The majority of the population of the country professes Christianity and is incorporated in Artsakh’s Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church, one of the autocephalous Christian courses (directions). 3 % of the country’s population was professed Islam of Shiite persuasion and Orthodox before the establishment of the Soviet regimes. As well a small number of people were professed Evangelists or Catholics. Both believers and atheists are distinguished with some tolerance to the representatives of other confessions. The external confessional manifestations are also treated with tolerance in Artsakh and ordinary people are not shocked by clothing and accessories that demonstrate adherence to any type of confession, or different religions.<span style=\"font-family: \" helvetica=\"\" neue\",=\"\" helvetica,=\"\" arial,=\"\" sans-serif;=\"\" font-size:=\"\" 16px;=\"\" font-style:=\"\" normal;=\"\" font-variant-ligatures:=\"\" font-variant-caps:=\"\" font-weight:=\"\" 400;\"=\"\">Propagation of Christianity in Artsakh and in the whole Armenian world dates to the first century, the period of the apostolic sermon.</span><span style=\"font-family: \" helvetica=\"\" neue\",=\"\" helvetica,=\"\" arial,=\"\" sans-serif;=\"\" font-size:=\"\" 16px;=\"\" font-style:=\"\" normal;=\"\" font-variant-ligatures:=\"\" font-variant-caps:=\"\" font-weight:=\"\" 400;\"=\"\"> </span><span style=\"font-family: \" helvetica=\"\" neue\",=\"\" helvetica,=\"\" arial,=\"\" sans-serif;=\"\" font-size:=\"\" 16px;=\"\" font-style:=\"\" normal;=\"\" font-variant-ligatures:=\"\" font-variant-caps:=\"\" font-weight:=\"\" 400;\"=\"\">The spiritual center of the diocese is the Gandzasar monastery,</span><span style=\"font-family: \" helvetica=\"\" neue\",=\"\" helvetica,=\"\" arial,=\"\" sans-serif;=\"\" font-size:=\"\" 16px;=\"\" font-style:=\"\" normal;=\"\" font-variant-ligatures:=\"\" font-variant-caps:=\"\" font-weight:=\"\" 400;\"=\"\"> </span></p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-6 col-sm-12\" contenteditable=\"false\">\r\n                                                <p>the administrative centre and residence of the head of the diocese is the city of Shoushi with its Amenaprkich cathedral - church called Ghazanchetsots.

Every Armenian knows that Noah, having reached this holy land, planted a vine in Armenia. That was the beginning of viticulture in Armenia. Archaeological excavations have shown that the Armenians were engaged in winemaking since the beginning of the 10th century BC .Since ancient times, the Armenians were able to produce a good wine, and grape growing techniques have remained virtually unchanged since the time of Urartu. So it is in Artsakh. In the courtyards of the families, involved in winemaking, were installed the winepresses. Exclusively male pressed the grapes. There is a special type of grapes in Arsakh with high sugar content, so it produces more alcohol. There are prevalent grape varieties as Haghtanak, Areni, Kishmish. Tourists in Artsakh can watch in rural areas how is distilled the traditional home-made mulberry vodka, which is famous for its healing properties. Mulberries are stored in barrels for 8-10 days until start to wander, and then the mixture is simmered in a big vat. Steam of the boiling mixture passes through the tube, is cooled by water and in the form of alcohol flows into the barrel. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12\">\r\n                                               <div class=\"img-block\">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-title=\"Feedback\" src=\"http://storage.loc/web/img/regions/festivals/Winemaking.jpg\" alt=\"Hyunot\" title=\"Hyunot\">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '                <div class=\"template-4\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                        <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-12 col-sm-12\">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable=\"false\">Karabakh cuisine, as well as the history of Karabakh, is rooted in antiquity.

Every Armenian knows that Noah, having reached this holy land, planted a vine in Armenia. That was the beginning of viticulture in Armenia. Archaeological excavations have shown that the Armenians were engaged in winemaking since the beginning of the 10th century BC .Since ancient times, the Armenians were able to produce a good wine, and grape growing techniques have remained virtually unchanged since the time of Urartu. So it is in Artsakh. In the courtyards of the families, involved in winemaking, were installed the winepresses. Exclusively male pressed the grapes. There is a special type of grapes in Arsakh with high sugar content, so it produces more alcohol. There are prevalent grape varieties as Haghtanak, Areni, Kishmish. Tourists in Artsakh can watch in rural areas how is distilled the traditional home-made mulberry vodka, which is famous for its healing properties. Mulberries are stored in barrels for 8-10 days until start to wander, and then the mixture is simmered in a big vat. Steam of the boiling mixture passes through the tube, is cooled by water and in the form of alcohol flows into the barrel. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12\">\r\n                                               <div class=\"img-block\">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-title=\"Feedback\" src=\"https://bltscottsdale.com/wp-content/themes/pashmina/images/blank.png\" alt=\"Hyunot\">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '                <div class=\"template-4\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                        <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-12 col-sm-12\">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable=\"false\">Karabakh cuisine, as well as the history of Karabakh, is rooted in antiquity.

Every Armenian knows that Noah, having reached this holy land, planted a vine in Armenia. That was the beginning of viticulture in Armenia. Archaeological excavations have shown that the Armenians were engaged in winemaking since the beginning of the 10th century BC .Since ancient times, the Armenians were able to produce a good wine, and grape growing techniques have remained virtually unchanged since the time of Urartu. So it is in Artsakh. In the courtyards of the families, involved in winemaking, were installed the winepresses. Exclusively male pressed the grapes. There is a special type of grapes in Arsakh with high sugar content, so it produces more alcohol. There are prevalent grape varieties as Haghtanak, Areni, Kishmish. Tourists in Artsakh can watch in rural areas how is distilled the traditional home-made mulberry vodka, which is famous for its healing properties. Mulberries are stored in barrels for 8-10 days until start to wander, and then the mixture is simmered in a big vat. Steam of the boiling mixture passes through the tube, is cooled by water and in the form of alcohol flows into the barrel. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12\">\r\n                                               <div class=\"img-block\">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-title=\"Feedback\" src=\"https://bltscottsdale.com/wp-content/themes/pashmina/images/blank.png\" alt=\"Hyunot\">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '                <div class=\"template-4\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                        <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-12 col-sm-12\">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable=\"false\">Karabakh cuisine, as well as the history of Karabakh, is rooted in antiquity.

Every Armenian knows that Noah, having reached this holy land, planted a vine in Armenia. That was the beginning of viticulture in Armenia. Archaeological excavations have shown that the Armenians were engaged in winemaking since the beginning of the 10th century BC .Since ancient times, the Armenians were able to produce a good wine, and grape growing techniques have remained virtually unchanged since the time of Urartu. So it is in Artsakh. In the courtyards of the families, involved in winemaking, were installed the winepresses. Exclusively male pressed the grapes. There is a special type of grapes in Arsakh with high sugar content, so it produces more alcohol. There are prevalent grape varieties as Haghtanak, Areni, Kishmish. Tourists in Artsakh can watch in rural areas how is distilled the traditional home-made mulberry vodka, which is famous for its healing properties. Mulberries are stored in barrels for 8-10 days until start to wander, and then the mixture is simmered in a big vat. Steam of the boiling mixture passes through the tube, is cooled by water and in the form of alcohol flows into the barrel. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12\">\r\n                                               <div class=\"img-block\">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-title=\"Feedback\" src=\"https://bltscottsdale.com/wp-content/themes/pashmina/images/blank.png\" alt=\"Hyunot\">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '                <div class=\"template-4\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                        <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-12 col-sm-12\">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable=\"false\">Karabakh cuisine, as well as the history of Karabakh, is rooted in antiquity.

Every Armenian knows that Noah, having reached this holy land, planted a vine in Armenia. That was the beginning of viticulture in Armenia. Archaeological excavations have shown that the Armenians were engaged in winemaking since the beginning of the 10th century BC .Since ancient times, the Armenians were able to produce a good wine, and grape growing techniques have remained virtually unchanged since the time of Urartu. So it is in Artsakh. In the courtyards of the families, involved in winemaking, were installed the winepresses. Exclusively male pressed the grapes. There is a special type of grapes in Arsakh with high sugar content, so it produces more alcohol. There are prevalent grape varieties as Haghtanak, Areni, Kishmish. Tourists in Artsakh can watch in rural areas how is distilled the traditional home-made mulberry vodka, which is famous for its healing properties. Mulberries are stored in barrels for 8-10 days until start to wander, and then the mixture is simmered in a big vat. Steam of the boiling mixture passes through the tube, is cooled by water and in the form of alcohol flows into the barrel. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12\">\r\n                                               <div class=\"img-block\">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-title=\"Feedback\" src=\"https://bltscottsdale.com/wp-content/themes/pashmina/images/blank.png\" alt=\"Hyunot\">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '                <div class=\"template-4\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                        <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-12 col-sm-12\">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable=\"false\">Karabakh cuisine, as well as the history of Karabakh, is rooted in antiquity.

Every Armenian knows that Noah, having reached this holy land, planted a vine in Armenia. That was the beginning of viticulture in Armenia. Archaeological excavations have shown that the Armenians were engaged in winemaking since the beginning of the 10th century BC .Since ancient times, the Armenians were able to produce a good wine, and grape growing techniques have remained virtually unchanged since the time of Urartu. So it is in Artsakh. In the courtyards of the families, involved in winemaking, were installed the winepresses. Exclusively male pressed the grapes. There is a special type of grapes in Arsakh with high sugar content, so it produces more alcohol. There are prevalent grape varieties as Haghtanak, Areni, Kishmish. Tourists in Artsakh can watch in rural areas how is distilled the traditional home-made mulberry vodka, which is famous for its healing properties. Mulberries are stored in barrels for 8-10 days until start to wander, and then the mixture is simmered in a big vat. Steam of the boiling mixture passes through the tube, is cooled by water and in the form of alcohol flows into the barrel. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12\">\r\n                                               <div class=\"img-block\">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-title=\"Feedback\" src=\"https://bltscottsdale.com/wp-content/themes/pashmina/images/blank.png\" alt=\"Hyunot\">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '                <div class=\"template-4\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                        <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-12 col-sm-12\">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable=\"false\">Karabakh cuisine, as well as the history of Karabakh, is rooted in antiquity.

Every Armenian knows that Noah, having reached this holy land, planted a vine in Armenia. That was the beginning of viticulture in Armenia. Archaeological excavations have shown that the Armenians were engaged in winemaking since the beginning of the 10th century BC .Since ancient times, the Armenians were able to produce a good wine, and grape growing techniques have remained virtually unchanged since the time of Urartu. So it is in Artsakh. In the courtyards of the families, involved in winemaking, were installed the winepresses. Exclusively male pressed the grapes. There is a special type of grapes in Arsakh with high sugar content, so it produces more alcohol. There are prevalent grape varieties as Haghtanak, Areni, Kishmish. Tourists in Artsakh can watch in rural areas how is distilled the traditional home-made mulberry vodka, which is famous for its healing properties. Mulberries are stored in barrels for 8-10 days until start to wander, and then the mixture is simmered in a big vat. Steam of the boiling mixture passes through the tube, is cooled by water and in the form of alcohol flows into the barrel. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12\">\r\n                                               <div class=\"img-block\">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-title=\"Feedback\" src=\"https://bltscottsdale.com/wp-content/themes/pashmina/images/blank.png\" alt=\"Hyunot\">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '                <div class=\"template-4\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                        <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-12 col-sm-12\">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable=\"false\">Karabakh cuisine, as well as the history of Karabakh, is rooted in antiquity.

In particular, we cannot refuse to try horse sorrel, mallow or snowdrop bulbs, which are first blanched in boiling water for a few minutes, and then either added to soups and salads, or seasoned with onions and eggs. Such dishes are usually served with yoghurt and nuts. An interesting component of the Karabakh cuisine is a special kind of bread – tonrahats, the flat bread baked in special cylindrical shape clay ovens dug in the ground (tonirs). Its baking is time-consuming ritual process; tonrahats is baked only in Karabakh. Also popular in Artsakh is the other kind of bread, traditional for the entire Armenian - lavash, which usually is used to roll up an Armenian cheese or meat, seasoned with onions, herbs and pepper. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12\">\r\n                                               <div class=\"img-block\">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-title=\"Feedback\" src=\"https://bltscottsdale.com/wp-content/themes/pashmina/images/blank.png\" alt=\"Hyunot\">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class=\"template-1\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                       <div class=\"item\">\r\n                                          <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-7 col-sm-12 com-xs-12\" contenteditable=\"false\">\r\n                                                <h2>Winemaking<br></h2>\r\n                                                <p>Winemaking. Every Armenian knows that Noah, having reached this holy land, planted a vine in Armenia. That was the beginning of viticulture in Armenia. Archaeological excavations have shown that the Armenians were engaged in winemaking since the beginning of the 10th century BC .Since ancient times, the Armenians were able to produce a good wine, and grape growing techniques have remained virtually unchanged since the time of Urartu. So it is in Artsakh. In the courtyards of the families, involved in winemaking, were installed the winepresses. Exclusively male pressed the grapes. There is a special type of grapes in Arsakh with high sugar content, so it produces more alcohol. There are prevalent grape varieties as Haghtanak, Areni, Kishmish. Tourists in Artsakh can watch in rural areas how is distilled the traditional home-made mulberry vodka, which is famous for its healing properties. Mulberries are stored in barrels for 8-10 days until start to wander, and then the mixture is simmered in a big vat. Steam of the boiling mixture passes through the tube, is cooled by water and in the form of alcohol flows into the barrel. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12\">\r\n                                               <div class=\"img-block\">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-title=\"Feedback\" src=\"https://bltscottsdale.com/wp-content/themes/pashmina/images/blank.png\" alt=\"Hyunot\">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 8, 'http://storage.loc/source', '1/ZonrIAB6bc61PSIDPJgpu0VG2cFRz-VU.jpg', NULL, NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1519516250, 1519516250, 1519595075);

Wall decorations, blankets, towels, tablecloths, skillfully embroidered curtains - all this at all times graced life, creating comfort and warmth. Every girl before marriage wove and embroidered items for dowry, and collected them all in canvas bag - boghchah. The boghchah itself was a masterpieces masterpiece of needlework. \"...Fabrics and colors colours, created by Artsakh women, cannot be compared with anything,\" - wrote the Arab historian Al-Maksuddasi. Skilled Artsakh creativity, lacy patterns (images) repeated images of medieval khachkars cars and miniatures. Women widely used simple stitch, chain, cross, knots, quiet, rococo seam over the edge and different types of yarns - cotton, linen, silk, wool.

And in our time in each house to keep something from \"my grandmother\'s dowry\" - embroidered pillow lace veil, or tied with a pair of Gulpa, which preserved the old patterns.

Before the spread of synthetic aniline dyes in the 1870\'s, the rich coloring of the Karabakh carpets was reached only with natural dyes derived from specific plants and minerals of region. Indigo (bluing) was imported from the East, and Vordan - from the Ararat valley. Some of the villages and settlements do not consider synthetic dyes, remaining true to the traditional natural methods.</span><br></p><div><br></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-6 col-sm-12\" contenteditable=\"false\">\r\n                                                <p>Director of the Armenian Studies Program of the University of Fresno, California, Tigran Kouyoumdjian argues that many different ancient sources testify to the skill of carpet weaving and the manufacture of other fabrics.

In the north of the region there passes the state boundary with Azerbaijan, in the west – with Armenia. In the south the region borders with Kashatagh region, the eastern border reaches Martakert region. The area of Karvatchar region is 1830 sq.km.. The regional center Karvatchar city situated 128 km away from the capital of RA, Stepanakert. The river of Tartar, which is the biggest waterway of Artsakh, flows along the territory of the region. The relief of Karvatchar region is mountainous and keenly indented. In different periods of the history these region was known under the name Vaykounik (till 12-13cc), Verin Khachen (13-18cc), Kolan (18-19cc). There have still remained numerous architectural monuments witnessing about the role this place had in the history of Armenia. Among the most famous monuments is Dadivank monastery, the fortress of Handaberd, the village of Tsar.Along with historical-architectural monuments the region is known as well for its natural resources – thick, virgin forests, rapid mountainous rivers, not big but very picturesque waterfalls and thermal mineral springs. All this gives both the lovers of antiquity and the lovers of extreme tourism, pedestrian and equestrian walks, tours along mountainous rivers, rock climbing and mountaineering a perfect opportunity to have a rest in Karvatchar region. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class=\"template-4\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                        <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-12 col-sm-12\">\r\n                                                <img data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-title=\"Feedback\" src=\"http://storage.loc/web/img/regions/regions/karvachar/karvachar-img.jpg\" alt=\"Hyunot\" title=\"karvachar\">\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '\r\n                <div class=\"template-4\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                                        <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-12 col-sm-12\">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable=\"false\">Karvatchar region occupies the north-western part of RA.

Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\r\n\r\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.
