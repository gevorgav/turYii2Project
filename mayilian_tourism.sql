Church and state are separated within the republic, and act separately from one another.The majority of the population of the country professes Christianity and is incorporated in Artsakh’s Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church, one of the autocephalous Christian courses (directions). 3 % of the country’s population was professed Islam of Shiite persuasion and Orthodox before the establishment of the Soviet regimes. As well a small number of people were professed Evangelists or Catholics. Both believers and atheists are distinguished with some tolerance to the representatives of other confessions. The external confessional manifestations are also treated with tolerance in Artsakh and ordinary people are not shocked by clothing and accessories that demonstrate adherence to any type of confession, or different religions.<span style="font-family: " helvetica="" neue",="" helvetica,="" arial,="" sans-serif;="" font-size:="" 16px;="" font-style:="" normal;="" font-variant-ligatures:="" font-variant-caps:="" font-weight:="" 400;"="">Propagation of Christianity in Artsakh and in the whole Armenian world dates to the first century, the period of the apostolic sermon.</span><span style="font-family: " helvetica="" neue",="" helvetica,="" arial,="" sans-serif;="" font-size:="" 16px;="" font-style:="" normal;="" font-variant-ligatures:="" font-variant-caps:="" font-weight:="" 400;"=""> </span><span style="font-family: " helvetica="" neue",="" helvetica,="" arial,="" sans-serif;="" font-size:="" 16px;="" font-style:="" normal;="" font-variant-ligatures:="" font-variant-caps:="" font-weight:="" 400;"="">The spiritual center of the diocese is the Gandzasar monastery,</span><span style="font-family: " helvetica="" neue",="" helvetica,="" arial,="" sans-serif;="" font-size:="" 16px;="" font-style:="" normal;="" font-variant-ligatures:="" font-variant-caps:="" font-weight:="" 400;"=""> </span></p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12" contenteditable="false">\r\n                                                <p>the administrative centre and residence of the head of the diocese is the city of Shoushi with its Amenaprkich cathedral - church called Ghazanchetsots.

Every Armenian knows that Noah, having reached this holy land, planted a vine in Armenia. That was the beginning of viticulture in Armenia. Archaeological excavations have shown that the Armenians were engaged in winemaking since the beginning of the 10th century BC .Since ancient times, the Armenians were able to produce a good wine, and grape growing techniques have remained virtually unchanged since the time of Urartu. So it is in Artsakh. In the courtyards of the families, involved in winemaking, were installed the winepresses. Exclusively male pressed the grapes. There is a special type of grapes in Arsakh with high sugar content, so it produces more alcohol. There are prevalent grape varieties as Haghtanak, Areni, Kishmish. Tourists in Artsakh can watch in rural areas how is distilled the traditional home-made mulberry vodka, which is famous for its healing properties. Mulberries are stored in barrels for 8-10 days until start to wander, and then the mixture is simmered in a big vat. Steam of the boiling mixture passes through the tube, is cooled by water and in the form of alcohol flows into the barrel. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12">\r\n                                               <div class="img-block">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-title="Feedback" src="http://storage.artsakh.travel/web/img/regions/festivals/Winemaking.jpg" alt="Hyunot" title="Hyunot">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '                <div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable="false">Karabakh cuisine, as well as the history of Karabakh, is rooted in antiquity.

Every Armenian knows that Noah, having reached this holy land, planted a vine in Armenia. That was the beginning of viticulture in Armenia. Archaeological excavations have shown that the Armenians were engaged in winemaking since the beginning of the 10th century BC .Since ancient times, the Armenians were able to produce a good wine, and grape growing techniques have remained virtually unchanged since the time of Urartu. So it is in Artsakh. In the courtyards of the families, involved in winemaking, were installed the winepresses. Exclusively male pressed the grapes. There is a special type of grapes in Arsakh with high sugar content, so it produces more alcohol. There are prevalent grape varieties as Haghtanak, Areni, Kishmish. Tourists in Artsakh can watch in rural areas how is distilled the traditional home-made mulberry vodka, which is famous for its healing properties. Mulberries are stored in barrels for 8-10 days until start to wander, and then the mixture is simmered in a big vat. Steam of the boiling mixture passes through the tube, is cooled by water and in the form of alcohol flows into the barrel. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12">\r\n                                               <div class="img-block">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-title="Feedback" src="https://bltscottsdale.com/wp-content/themes/pashmina/images/blank.png" alt="Hyunot">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '                <div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable="false">Karabakh cuisine, as well as the history of Karabakh, is rooted in antiquity.

Every Armenian knows that Noah, having reached this holy land, planted a vine in Armenia. That was the beginning of viticulture in Armenia. Archaeological excavations have shown that the Armenians were engaged in winemaking since the beginning of the 10th century BC .Since ancient times, the Armenians were able to produce a good wine, and grape growing techniques have remained virtually unchanged since the time of Urartu. So it is in Artsakh. In the courtyards of the families, involved in winemaking, were installed the winepresses. Exclusively male pressed the grapes. There is a special type of grapes in Arsakh with high sugar content, so it produces more alcohol. There are prevalent grape varieties as Haghtanak, Areni, Kishmish. Tourists in Artsakh can watch in rural areas how is distilled the traditional home-made mulberry vodka, which is famous for its healing properties. Mulberries are stored in barrels for 8-10 days until start to wander, and then the mixture is simmered in a big vat. Steam of the boiling mixture passes through the tube, is cooled by water and in the form of alcohol flows into the barrel. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12">\r\n                                               <div class="img-block">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-title="Feedback" src="https://bltscottsdale.com/wp-content/themes/pashmina/images/blank.png" alt="Hyunot">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '                <div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable="false">Karabakh cuisine, as well as the history of Karabakh, is rooted in antiquity.

Every Armenian knows that Noah, having reached this holy land, planted a vine in Armenia. That was the beginning of viticulture in Armenia. Archaeological excavations have shown that the Armenians were engaged in winemaking since the beginning of the 10th century BC .Since ancient times, the Armenians were able to produce a good wine, and grape growing techniques have remained virtually unchanged since the time of Urartu. So it is in Artsakh. In the courtyards of the families, involved in winemaking, were installed the winepresses. Exclusively male pressed the grapes. There is a special type of grapes in Arsakh with high sugar content, so it produces more alcohol. There are prevalent grape varieties as Haghtanak, Areni, Kishmish. Tourists in Artsakh can watch in rural areas how is distilled the traditional home-made mulberry vodka, which is famous for its healing properties. Mulberries are stored in barrels for 8-10 days until start to wander, and then the mixture is simmered in a big vat. Steam of the boiling mixture passes through the tube, is cooled by water and in the form of alcohol flows into the barrel. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12">\r\n                                               <div class="img-block">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-title="Feedback" src="https://bltscottsdale.com/wp-content/themes/pashmina/images/blank.png" alt="Hyunot">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '                <div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable="false">Karabakh cuisine, as well as the history of Karabakh, is rooted in antiquity.

Every Armenian knows that Noah, having reached this holy land, planted a vine in Armenia. That was the beginning of viticulture in Armenia. Archaeological excavations have shown that the Armenians were engaged in winemaking since the beginning of the 10th century BC .Since ancient times, the Armenians were able to produce a good wine, and grape growing techniques have remained virtually unchanged since the time of Urartu. So it is in Artsakh. In the courtyards of the families, involved in winemaking, were installed the winepresses. Exclusively male pressed the grapes. There is a special type of grapes in Arsakh with high sugar content, so it produces more alcohol. There are prevalent grape varieties as Haghtanak, Areni, Kishmish. Tourists in Artsakh can watch in rural areas how is distilled the traditional home-made mulberry vodka, which is famous for its healing properties. Mulberries are stored in barrels for 8-10 days until start to wander, and then the mixture is simmered in a big vat. Steam of the boiling mixture passes through the tube, is cooled by water and in the form of alcohol flows into the barrel. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12">\r\n                                               <div class="img-block">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-title="Feedback" src="https://bltscottsdale.com/wp-content/themes/pashmina/images/blank.png" alt="Hyunot">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '                <div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable="false">Karabakh cuisine, as well as the history of Karabakh, is rooted in antiquity.

Every Armenian knows that Noah, having reached this holy land, planted a vine in Armenia. That was the beginning of viticulture in Armenia. Archaeological excavations have shown that the Armenians were engaged in winemaking since the beginning of the 10th century BC .Since ancient times, the Armenians were able to produce a good wine, and grape growing techniques have remained virtually unchanged since the time of Urartu. So it is in Artsakh. In the courtyards of the families, involved in winemaking, were installed the winepresses. Exclusively male pressed the grapes. There is a special type of grapes in Arsakh with high sugar content, so it produces more alcohol. There are prevalent grape varieties as Haghtanak, Areni, Kishmish. Tourists in Artsakh can watch in rural areas how is distilled the traditional home-made mulberry vodka, which is famous for its healing properties. Mulberries are stored in barrels for 8-10 days until start to wander, and then the mixture is simmered in a big vat. Steam of the boiling mixture passes through the tube, is cooled by water and in the form of alcohol flows into the barrel. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12">\r\n                                               <div class="img-block">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-title="Feedback" src="https://bltscottsdale.com/wp-content/themes/pashmina/images/blank.png" alt="Hyunot">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '                <div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable="false">Karabakh cuisine, as well as the history of Karabakh, is rooted in antiquity.

Every Armenian knows that Noah, having reached this holy land, planted a vine in Armenia. That was the beginning of viticulture in Armenia. Archaeological excavations have shown that the Armenians were engaged in winemaking since the beginning of the 10th century BC .Since ancient times, the Armenians were able to produce a good wine, and grape growing techniques have remained virtually unchanged since the time of Urartu. So it is in Artsakh. In the courtyards of the families, involved in winemaking, were installed the winepresses. Exclusively male pressed the grapes. There is a special type of grapes in Arsakh with high sugar content, so it produces more alcohol. There are prevalent grape varieties as Haghtanak, Areni, Kishmish. Tourists in Artsakh can watch in rural areas how is distilled the traditional home-made mulberry vodka, which is famous for its healing properties. Mulberries are stored in barrels for 8-10 days until start to wander, and then the mixture is simmered in a big vat. Steam of the boiling mixture passes through the tube, is cooled by water and in the form of alcohol flows into the barrel. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12">\r\n                                               <div class="img-block">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-title="Feedback" src="https://bltscottsdale.com/wp-content/themes/pashmina/images/blank.png" alt="Hyunot">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '                <div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable="false">Karabakh cuisine, as well as the history of Karabakh, is rooted in antiquity.

In particular, we cannot refuse to try horse sorrel, mallow or snowdrop bulbs, which are first blanched in boiling water for a few minutes, and then either added to soups and salads, or seasoned with onions and eggs. Such dishes are usually served with yoghurt and nuts. An interesting component of the Karabakh cuisine is a special kind of bread – tonrahats, the flat bread baked in special cylindrical shape clay ovens dug in the ground (tonirs). Its baking is time-consuming ritual process; tonrahats is baked only in Karabakh. Also popular in Artsakh is the other kind of bread, traditional for the entire Armenian - lavash, which usually is used to roll up an Armenian cheese or meat, seasoned with onions, herbs and pepper. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12">\r\n                                               <div class="img-block">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-title="Feedback" src="https://bltscottsdale.com/wp-content/themes/pashmina/images/blank.png" alt="Hyunot">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class="template-1">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                       <div class="item">\r\n                                          <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-7 col-sm-12 com-xs-12" contenteditable="false">\r\n                                                <h2>Winemaking<br></h2>\r\n                                                <p>Winemaking. Every Armenian knows that Noah, having reached this holy land, planted a vine in Armenia. That was the beginning of viticulture in Armenia. Archaeological excavations have shown that the Armenians were engaged in winemaking since the beginning of the 10th century BC .Since ancient times, the Armenians were able to produce a good wine, and grape growing techniques have remained virtually unchanged since the time of Urartu. So it is in Artsakh. In the courtyards of the families, involved in winemaking, were installed the winepresses. Exclusively male pressed the grapes. There is a special type of grapes in Arsakh with high sugar content, so it produces more alcohol. There are prevalent grape varieties as Haghtanak, Areni, Kishmish. Tourists in Artsakh can watch in rural areas how is distilled the traditional home-made mulberry vodka, which is famous for its healing properties. Mulberries are stored in barrels for 8-10 days until start to wander, and then the mixture is simmered in a big vat. Steam of the boiling mixture passes through the tube, is cooled by water and in the form of alcohol flows into the barrel. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-5 col-sm-12 com-xs-12">\r\n                                               <div class="img-block">\r\n                                                   <img data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-title="Feedback" src="https://bltscottsdale.com/wp-content/themes/pashmina/images/blank.png" alt="Hyunot">\r\n                                               </div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                          </div>\r\n                                       </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 8, 'http://storage.artsakh.travel/source', '1/ZonrIAB6bc61PSIDPJgpu0VG2cFRz-VU.jpg', NULL, NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1519516250, 1519516250, 1519595075);

Wall decorations, blankets, towels, tablecloths, skillfully embroidered curtains - all this at all times graced life, creating comfort and warmth. Every girl before marriage wove and embroidered items for dowry, and collected them all in canvas bag - boghchah. The boghchah itself was a masterpieces masterpiece of needlework. "...Fabrics and colors colours, created by Artsakh women, cannot be compared with anything," - wrote the Arab historian Al-Maksuddasi. Skilled Artsakh creativity, lacy patterns (images) repeated images of medieval khachkars cars and miniatures. Women widely used simple stitch, chain, cross, knots, quiet, rococo seam over the edge and different types of yarns - cotton, linen, silk, wool. Often in the process of creativity needlewoman used beads, pearls, gems, sequins, coins.\r\n                                                </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12" contenteditable="false">\r\n                                                <p>In various tissues, leather, felt they create images, patterns, narrative paintings, portraits.

Unique designs make them true masterpieces. Both sides of gulpa, top and bottom, have white square-shaped patterns, rounded with knit openwork patterns. And in our time in each house to keep something from "my grandmother''s dowry" - embroidered pillow lace veil, or tied with a pair of Gulpa, which preserved the old patterns.

Before the spread of synthetic aniline dyes in the 1870''s, the rich coloring of the Karabakh carpets was reached only with natural dyes derived from specific plants and minerals of region. Indigo (bluing) was imported from the East, and Vordan - from the Ararat valley. Some of the villages and settlements do not consider synthetic dyes, remaining true to the traditional natural methods.</span><br></p><div><br></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12" contenteditable="false">\r\n                                                <p>Director of the Armenian Studies Program of the University of Fresno, California, Tigran Kouyoumdjian argues that many different ancient sources testify to the skill of carpet weaving and the manufacture of other fabrics.

The regional center Karvatchar city situated 128 km away from the capital of RA, Stepanakert. The river of Tartar, which is the biggest waterway of Artsakh, flows along the territory of the region. The relief of Karvatchar region is mountainous and keenly indented.

There have still remained numerous architectural monuments witnessing about the role this place had in the history of Armenia. Among the most famous monuments is Dadivank monastery, the fortress of Handaberd, the village of Tsar.Along with historical-architectural monuments the region is known as well for its natural resources – thick, virgin forests, rapid mountainous rivers, not big but very picturesque waterfalls and thermal mineral springs.

Since that time, started the formation and penetration of the Armenian culture in the territory of Artsakh. In the 1st century B.C., Armenian King Tigran II the Great founded the city of Tigranakert – one of the four cities named after him at that time. After the partition of Armenia in the 4th century A.D., Artsakh became part of the Caucasian Albania (vassal of Persia) which, in its turn, ceased to exist at the beginning of the 8th century after the Arab invasion. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable="false">9th – 11th centuries.

Artsakhian village is a unique phenomenon: more than half of the villages of the land have 500-600-years-old history, some of them were founded 800, 900 years ago, i.e. earlier than many European capitals. And if you count the traditions kept and the old way of life along with the ancient history, so you can imagine the opportunities the lovers of agrotourism have to take a rest far from the urban life and problems. Since 2009 in some villages (Badara, Ghshlagh-Tsaghkashat in Askeran region, Chartar, Ashan in Martouni region) guest houses with all the modern conveniences and high level service have been opened in old Artsakhian living quarters. The Landlords are always glad to accept you with the native Artsakhian hospitality and cordiality, to organize equestrian and pedestrian walks around the village and its surroundings and to tell the history of the village and legends connected with it.\r\n                                                </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable="false">Depending on the season tourists can take part in grape or mulberry harvests, and watch the process of making the famous Artsakhian mulberry vodka, famous from times of Alexander the Macedonian. Or, they can watch the cooking of the unique product called doshab, a syrup of mulberry that has unique healing properties. Visitors to a village may see how sheep are sheared, the wool of which is used to make carpets that are known and sold all over the world.

Artsakhian village is a unique phenomenon: more than half of the villages of the land have 500-600-years-old history, some of them were founded 800, 900 years ago, i.e. earlier than many European capitals. And if you count the traditions kept and the old way of life along with the ancient history, so you can imagine the opportunities the lovers of agrotourism have to take a rest far from the urban life and problems. Since 2009 in some villages (Badara, Ghshlagh-Tsaghkashat in Askeran region, Chartar, Ashan in Martouni region) guest houses with all the modern conveniences and high level service have been opened in old Artsakhian living quarters. The Landlords are always glad to accept you with the native Artsakhian hospitality and cordiality, to organize equestrian and pedestrian walks around the village and its surroundings and to tell the history of the village and legends connected with it.\r\n                                                </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable="false">Depending on the season tourists can take part in grape or mulberry harvests, and watch the process of making the famous Artsakhian mulberry vodka, famous from times of Alexander the Macedonian. Or, they can watch the cooking of the unique product called doshab, a syrup of mulberry that has unique healing properties. Visitors to a village may see how sheep are sheared, the wool of which is used to make carpets that are known and sold all over the world. They may also have an opportunity to visit farms, apiaries, and to visit the high alpine pastures together with the sheperds and sheep.

It was built in 1883, designed by the Iranian architect Kerbala Sefi Khan in the centre of the Muslim part of the city. The main facade of the mosque with three arched entrances emphasizes two tall minarets. Both minarets are elaborately decorated with colorful geometric patterns. In front of the mosque was built an octagonal pool with a fountain. In Soviet times, the mosque was transformed into a historical museum. In May 1992, during the war for the liberation of Shoushi, the mosque was badly damaged. Currently are held restoration works. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <h2 contenteditable="false">Other cultural and historical buildings of Shoushi</h2>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable="false">Inner Mosque, or Mosque of Gezhara Aga, was built in 1875, designed by the same architect Kerbala Sefi Khan.

It was built in 1883, designed by the Iranian architect Kerbala Sefi Khan in the centre of the Muslim part of the city. The main facade of the mosque with three arched entrances emphasizes two tall minarets. Both minarets are elaborately decorated with colorful geometric patterns. In front of the mosque was built an octagonal pool with a fountain. In Soviet times, the mosque was transformed into a historical museum. In May 1992, during the war for the liberation of Shoushi, the mosque was badly damaged.

After joining of Karabakh to Russia, its capital city of Shoushi was at the crossroads of trade routes linking Iran with Russia. The rapid development of trade between Iran and Russia resulted in the formation of the Shiite Muslim community in the city. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <img data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-title="Feedback" src="http://storage.artsakh.travel/web/img/regions/multicultural-2.jpg" alt="Hyunot" title="Hyunot">\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <h2 contenteditable="false">Uptown Mosque of Shoushi</h2>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable="false">One of the most famous monuments of Islamic Persian culture is the mosque of Shoushi. It was built in 1883, designed by the Iranian architect Kerbala Sefi Khan in the centre of the Muslim part of the city. The main facade of the mosque with three arched entrances emphasizes two tall minarets. Both minarets are elaborately decorated with colorful geometric patterns. In front of the mosque was built an octagonal pool with a fountain. In Soviet times, the mosque was transformed into a historical museum. In May 1992, during the war for the liberation of Shoushi, the mosque was badly damaged. Currently are held restoration works. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <h2 contenteditable="false">Other cultural and historical buildings of Shoushi</h2>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable="false">Inner Mosque, or Mosque of Gezhara Aga, was built in 1875, designed by the same architect Kerbala Sefi Khan.

The parishioners were living in Shoushi family of imperial officials and soldiers of the imperial army, a regiment of which was stationed in the city. The impressive building for its architecture played a large city-forming role and was the centre of Russian culture in Shoushi.

It was built in 1883, designed by the Iranian architect Kerbala Sefi Khan in the centre of the Muslim part of the city. The main facade of the mosque with three arched entrances emphasizes two tall minarets. Both minarets are elaborately decorated with colorful geometric patterns. In front of the mosque was built an octagonal pool with a fountain. In Soviet times, the mosque was transformed into a historical museum. In May 1992, during the war for the liberation of Shoushi, the mosque was badly damaged.

After joining of Karabakh to Russia, its capital city of Shoushi was at the crossroads of trade routes linking Iran with Russia. The rapid development of trade between Iran and Russia resulted in the formation of the Shiite Muslim community in the city. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <img data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-title="Feedback" src="http://storage.artsakh.travel/web/img/regions/multicultural-2.jpg" alt="Hyunot" title="Hyunot">\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <h2 contenteditable="false">Uptown Mosque of Shoushi</h2>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable="false">One of the most famous monuments of Islamic Persian culture is the mosque of Shoushi. It was built in 1883, designed by the Iranian architect Kerbala Sefi Khan in the centre of the Muslim part of the city. The main facade of the mosque with three arched entrances emphasizes two tall minarets. Both minarets are elaborately decorated with colorful geometric patterns. In front of the mosque was built an octagonal pool with a fountain. In Soviet times, the mosque was transformed into a historical museum. In May 1992, during the war for the liberation of Shoushi, the mosque was badly damaged. Currently are held restoration works. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <h2 contenteditable="false">Other cultural and historical buildings of Shoushi</h2>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable="false">Inner Mosque, or Mosque of Gezhara Aga, was built in 1875, designed by the same architect Kerbala Sefi Khan.

The parishioners were living in Shoushi family of imperial officials and soldiers of the imperial army, a regiment of which was stationed in the city. The impressive building for its architecture played a large city-forming role and was the centre of Russian culture in Shoushi.

It was built in 1883, designed by the Iranian architect Kerbala Sefi Khan in the centre of the Muslim part of the city. The main facade of the mosque with three arched entrances emphasizes two tall minarets. Both minarets are elaborately decorated with colorful geometric patterns. In front of the mosque was built an octagonal pool with a fountain. In Soviet times, the mosque was transformed into a historical museum. In May 1992, during the war for the liberation of Shoushi, the mosque was badly damaged.

After joining of Karabakh to Russia, its capital city of Shoushi was at the crossroads of trade routes linking Iran with Russia. The rapid development of trade between Iran and Russia resulted in the formation of the Shiite Muslim community in the city. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <img data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-title="Feedback" src="http://storage.artsakh.travel/web/img/regions/multicultural-2.jpg" alt="Hyunot" title="Hyunot">\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <h2 contenteditable="false">Uptown Mosque of Shoushi</h2>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable="false">One of the most famous monuments of Islamic Persian culture is the mosque of Shoushi. It was built in 1883, designed by the Iranian architect Kerbala Sefi Khan in the centre of the Muslim part of the city. The main facade of the mosque with three arched entrances emphasizes two tall minarets. Both minarets are elaborately decorated with colorful geometric patterns. In front of the mosque was built an octagonal pool with a fountain. In Soviet times, the mosque was transformed into a historical museum. In May 1992, during the war for the liberation of Shoushi, the mosque was badly damaged. Currently are held restoration works. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <h2 contenteditable="false">Other cultural and historical buildings of Shoushi</h2>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable="false">Inner Mosque, or Mosque of Gezhara Aga, was built in 1875, designed by the same architect Kerbala Sefi Khan.

The parishioners were living in Shoushi family of imperial officials and soldiers of the imperial army, a regiment of which was stationed in the city. The impressive building for its architecture played a large city-forming role and was the centre of Russian culture in Shoushi.

It was built in 1883, designed by the Iranian architect Kerbala Sefi Khan in the centre of the Muslim part of the city. The main facade of the mosque with three arched entrances emphasizes two tall minarets. Both minarets are elaborately decorated with colorful geometric patterns. In front of the mosque was built an octagonal pool with a fountain. In Soviet times, the mosque was transformed into a historical museum. In May 1992, during the war for the liberation of Shoushi, the mosque was badly damaged.

According to legend, come down to our days, the monastery is named after the swallow, which saved the lives of builders of the monastery. Noting that a poisonous snake got into the pot in which the food is cooked, she tried to attract the attention of builders with chirping, but they did not understand its prevention. Then swallow threw herself into a pot of lunch and thus saved them from certain death. The monastery was founded on the site of a pagan temple in the V-VII centuries. The church is crowned with a basilica with nave, one of the most remarkable creations of Armenian architecture. The church impresses with dimensions and wall mural paintings.

A majestic white city, surrounded in green gardens, lasted until the 14th century. As expected, the excavations have revealed the details of cultural buildings of a large and strong city, heading a rich cultural life. Materials and structures found during excavations confirm that Tigranakert was a large city with a strict plan, built with the help of construction equipment.

Thanks to an artificially created terraces Tigranakert, stretches down the mountainside to the foot of it. It was surrounded by mighty strong walls and passages, punched in the rocks. A majestic white city, surrounded in green gardens, lasted until the 14th century. As expected, the excavations have revealed the details of cultural buildings of a large and strong city, heading a rich cultural life. Materials and structures found during excavations confirm that Tigranakert was a large city with a strict plan, built with the help of construction equipment. For the preservation of Armenian historical and cultural heritage of the early Middle Ages, in December 2008, according to the decision of the Government of the Artsakh, at the site of the ancient city of Tigranakert was established the State Historical and Cultural Reserve. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable="false">Excavations.

The discovery of the remains of the first owners of Azokh cave is undoubtedly a great scientific significance of the phenomenon. Prior to that, the remains of Neanderthal man have been found in only four regions of the world - Sidi Abd Eragmene (Morocco), Steinheim (Germany), Spanokombe (England) and Sediadelle Diabolon (Italy). Jaw of Neanderthal found in the cave Azokh in the scientific literature is designated number five. Azokh discovery is of great importance not only for the restoration of the physical image of the ancient Neanderthal, but also confirms the statement of scientists that Armenia and the Caucasus are among the areas of residence and origin of ancient man. At the end of the 19th century, a stone statue of a woman in national costume was discovered in the cave. Until now, in the cave was found more than 20 thousand bones of 43 different species of animals, about six thousand of stone tools, traces of primitive art, pottery. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div><div class="template-4">\r\n                                    <div class="container">\r\n                                        <div class="row">\r\n                                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">\r\n                                                <p contenteditable="false">Of great scientific interest is also a colony of bats (about 200,000 individuals) living in the maze of caves. There are found five types here, some of which are only found in a cave Azokh. "Treasure Cave" has not opened all its secrets. Since 2003, this large settlement of prehistoric man is systematically studied by Armenian-English-Spanish archaeological expedition. </p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 12, 'http://storage.artsakh.travel/source', '1/YHsfw3DGnZ6Ka02pv7gTQggyNxnD7C5M.jpg', 'http://storage.artsakh.travel/source', '1/Bl7mWOg1oCWDImhgVbCQLB4CmeoiK9Qi.jpg', 1, 1, 1, 1521233990, 1521233990, 1523387350);

In the 18th century, with the support of Dizak melik Yegan the territory of the monastery expanded. From an architectural point of view, Gtchavank monastery complex is one of the most interesting monuments of the centuries-old Armenian culture.

It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\r\n\r\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.
